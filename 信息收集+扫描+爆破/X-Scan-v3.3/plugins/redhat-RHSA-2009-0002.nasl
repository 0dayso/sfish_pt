  Updated thunderbird packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML mail content.
  An HTML mail message containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird
  to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-5500, CVE-2008-5501, CVE-2008-5502, CVE-2008-5511,
  CVE-2008-5512, CVE-2008-5513)

  Several flaws were found in the way malformed content was processed. An
  HTML mail message containing specially-crafted content could potentially
  trick a Thunderbird user into surrendering sensitive information.
  (CVE-2008-5503, CVE-2008-5506, CVE-2008-5507)

  Note: JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird; the above
  issues are not exploitable unless JavaScript is enabled.

  A flaw was found in the way malformed URLs were processed by
  Thunderbird. This flaw could prevent various URL sanitization mechanisms
  from properly parsing a malicious URL. (CVE-2008-5508)

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
